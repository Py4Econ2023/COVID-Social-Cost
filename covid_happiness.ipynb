        "As policy-making during an epidemic is all about making economic tradeoffs, one would like to quantify the gains and losses in the factors a government is is trading off between. The trade-offs to monetary factors and other classical economic factors are well documented, of course. However, the social costs of viral cases less so (among other forms of social costs involved in a pandemic). One may make an attempt to quantify the social costs of the number of cases of such a virus in your country by looking at the causal effect of COVID-19 cases on the average sentiment of how people express themselves online."

You will start by carrying out this analysis for the UK. A clear confounder here are government restrictions to curb the spread of the virus.

        "1. One option is to expand this analysis to different countries. Here, it is important to realise that comparing the coefficients of different countries is not justified. Namely, different countries may confirm cases in different ways. Looking at proportional increases in the number of cases will remove this problem, but will disregard the base level of new cases in the country which of course influences the magnitude of the effect on the average sentiment for a given proportional increase in the number of cases.\n",
        "2. Data visualisation: plot the comovement of the variables of interest over time or something else you are interested in seeing that can give a new insight into the problem.\n",
        "3. There may be other confounders present in the regression that I can't think of right now. If you can think of any, download the data for these, clean that data and create a new variable to run the regression with again.\n",
        "4. Scrape tweets from random time intervals to reduce bias induced by Twitter's feed selection methods. Documentation available for some of the keywords necessary in the Twitter search query to do this can be found [here](https://github.com/igorbrigadir/twitter-advanced-search).\n",
        "5. Filtering out spam tweets. You can approach this Natural Language Processing (NLP) problem in various ways, from as advanced as using AI classification methods as looking for duplicated tweets in your list of scraped tweets. You can always combine methods like these, of course.\n",
        "6. Improving the tweet cleaning function.\n",
        "7. Running the regression with different model specifications of how the confounder affects the outcome variable and the dependent variable. Namely, it may be the case that the start of heavy restrictions is not so bad yet, but that people get tired of it the longer these heavy restrictions are in place. You would need to transform the restriction variable to carry out the regression with this different definition of the control variable."
